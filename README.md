- 👋 Hi, I’m @slimarine
- 👀 I’m the official website of the SLIM Lab at Dalian Maritime University, with a special focus on the Science behind Lightweight Innovations for Marine applications (SLIM).
- 🐟 The principal investigator of the SLIM lab is Dr. Zhaogui Wang (zw-am.github.io)
- 🌊 Currently, the research interests lie in the fundamental science of fibrous composites additive manufacturing (producing complex geometry with high weight-to-strength ratio, for, e.g., on-site ship maintenance spare parts supply), marine-based biomimetic design (creating natural metamaterials like cuttlebones), high-efficiency large area additive manufacturing (for rapid fabrication of marine structures).
- ⚓️ More updates coming soon.
